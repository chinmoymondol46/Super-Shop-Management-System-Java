# Super-Shop-Management-System-Java
A super shop management system developed with java

**Introduction:**

A super shop management system allows the employees to manage the super shop efficiently and flawlessly. In this current digital era a system which is easy to use and understand for managing the super shop is a must. This system provides an efficient way of managing the super shop information. It also allows the customer to purchase and pay for the items purchased.

**User Category:**

There are two types of Users here. They are:

- Admin
- Cashier

**Feature List:**

In this project the &quot;Admin&quot; has the following features:

- add, remove and edit employees
- add, and edit stock
- See sale info

In this project the &quot;Cashier&quot; has the following features:

- Sell items from the stock
- Create bill
- See sale info

**Tools Used:**

To develop this project we have used the following:

- NetBeans IDE
- XAMPP

**OOP and Java Concepts Used:**

- Abstraction and Interfaces.
- Encapsulation
- Swing and AWT libraries for implementing the GUI
- ArrayList
- Exception Handling

**Limitations and Possible Future Improvements:**

In the project, there is no instance of customer interaction. If more than the available quantity of a product is sold, it will carry out the action by making the available quantity into a negative amount. When billing, the window must be closed and reopened for a new bill.

In the future, the customer side may be implemented. A catalogue of items may be shown to the customer through a separate interface through customer login. Implementation of customers with special privileges may be done. A method for switching users easily may also be implemented.
